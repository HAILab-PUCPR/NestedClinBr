# NestedClinBr

**in progress**

NestedClinBr is a new corpus containing nested and discontinuous entities in Brazilian Portuguese clinical narratives.

The main goal of NestedClinBr is to provide a human-annotated corpus that can be used for learning and evaluating different machine learning models to extract valuable medical information in the Portuguese language, in special nested and discontinuous entities, an important but less explored task.

In the context of clinical NLP, the recognition of entities is commonly used for the identification of diseases, body parts, medications, and other relevant information, facilitating, for example, the detection of risk factors and medical decision-making. As NestedClinBr, although small, can contribute to the healthcare domain, it will be freely available to the research
community.
